## [Charge Deposition](event967_pulses_q)

Colour-coded charge deposition.


## [Simple Ambiguities](event967_pulses_a_pca)

Ambiguity resolution employing a principal component analysis.
Green hits are accepted while dark red ones are rejected.
This is achieved by selecting the ambiguity closest to the eigenvector of the point cloud with the largest eigenvalue, represented by the blue line.


## [Detailed Ambiguities](event967_pulses_a_det)

Colour-coded degree of ambiguity.
Light green are unambiguous hits while dark green are selected solutions of ambiguous hits.
Dark red through black are rejected solutions of ambiguous hits where darker colour represents a higher degree of ambiguity.
